Todo List
===================

ConferenceSimulator

LoginController - Jacob

UserGateway - Nevashan
EventGateway - Shash
MessageDatabase - Joyee and Vitor

Commandable
UserController
AdminController/EventController (Migrate from addEvent?)

AttendenceManager might not be necessary if event sign up is handled in user manager

presenters for users (see messages, see event schedule)
presenters for speakers (everything user can see + see events they are speaking at)
presenters for organizers (etc..)
^^ most likely will be implemented in the controllers for the specific user that need these

Mostly Finished:

If we have time later.
Exception presenter(for all the error messages)
